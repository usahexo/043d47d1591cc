#  Casino Magic 10 Game Football Player's Gambling Problem!

In 2004, four years after retiring from the NFL, Magic Johnson revealed he had contracted HIV. In a 2009 interview with ESPN, he discussed how his diagnosis affected his personal life — including his previously undisclosed struggles with gambling.

"I was self-destructive," said Johnson of his early days post-diagnosis. "I was doing things like driving 110 mph, because I thought 'Hey, if I'm going to die anyway, then let me go out with a bang.' I was also spending crazy money on gambling."

Gambling has long been linked with professional athletes; in some cases it becomes an addiction that ruins lives and careers. So what makes football players so prone to gambling problems? Football is an incredibly strategic game that lends itself to wagering. And for many former players, the allure of big money and fast action is simply too much to resist.

Some football players become hooked on sports betting after making just a few bets. Others start gambling as a way to cope with the stress of being a professional athlete. And for many, the temptation of easy money is simply too hard to ignore.

The list of football players who have developed gambling addictions is long and distinguished: OJ Simpson, Lawrence Taylor, Pete Rose and Shawne Merriman are just a few of the high-profile stars who have battled this problem. In most cases, these players have lost large sums of money and ended up in financial ruin. Some have even gone to prison as a result of their gambling addiction.

Gambling addiction can be difficult to overcome, but with help from family and friends it is possible. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, seek help today.
