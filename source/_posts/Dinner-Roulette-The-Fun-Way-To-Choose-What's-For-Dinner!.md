#  Dinner Roulette: A Great Way To Get Kids Involved In Cooking!

Getting kids involved in cooking is a great way to teach them about nutrition, healthy eating, and responsible food preparation. And what better way to do that than with a game of Dinner Roulette?

To play, you’ll need a list of kid-friendly recipes, as well as some basic kitchen supplies like measuring cups and spoons, knives, cutting boards, and pots and pans.

Divide the recipes into two categories: appetizers and main courses. Then, assign each recipe a number from 1 to 12. Write the numbers on slips of paper and fold them up so the numbers are hidden.

Put all of the folded papers into a hat or bowl and have one person draw out a paper at random. That’s the recipe your family will be preparing for dinner tonight!

Appetizers can include things like deviled eggs, cheese cubes served with grape tomatoes and pepper strips, or simple fruit skewers. Main courses could be anything from tacos to salmon en papillote to oven-baked chicken drumsticks.

Get creative with the ingredients and have fun with Dinner Roulette!
