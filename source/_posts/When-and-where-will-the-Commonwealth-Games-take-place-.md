#  What is the expected economic impact of the Commonwealth Games? 

The Commonwealth Games are a sporting event which takes place every four years, with the latest edition taking place in Australia in 2018. The event is open to all members of the Commonwealth of Nations, a intergovernmental organisation of 53 member states. Participation in the games is considered to be a great honour, and many athletes from around the world compete in a wide variety of sports.

The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) expects the economic impact of the 2018 Commonwealth Games to be significant. It has been predicted that the games will generate over A$2 billion in economic output, and create almost 10,000 jobs. In addition, it is expected that visitors will inject over A$1 billion into the local economy. This is good news for Australia, which is still recovering from the global financial crisis.

The Commonwealth Games are not just about sport; they are also a major cultural event. The opening and closing ceremonies are always spectacular, and attract large numbers of spectators. The CGF expects that more than 1.5 million people will attend events at the various venues across Australia during the games. This provides a significant boost to the tourism industry, and helps to spread awareness of Australia as a tourist destination.

All in all, the Commonwealth Games are expected to have a positive economic impact on Australia. This is great news for locals, who can look forward to increased job opportunities and spending by tourists. It is also good news for athletes and fans from around the world who get to experience everything that Australia has to offer.
