#  What Are the Chances of Winning at Texas Rangers?

The Texas Rangers are a professional baseball team based in Arlington, Texas. They play in the American League West division. The team was founded in 1961 as the Washington Senators and moved to Arlington in 1972.

The Rangers have made the playoffs six times and have won two division titles and one American League pennant. The club is owned by Bob Simpson and Ray Davis, who purchased it from Tom Hicks in 2010.

In 2016, the Rangers finished second in their division with an 88–74 record and lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALDS. In 2017, they again finished second with a 78–84 record and were swept by the Houston Astros in the ALDS.

As of September 2018, the odds of winning the World Series for the Texas Rangers are 25/1 according to OddsShark. 

One key factor that will influence the Rangers' odds for winning this year is how well their newest acquisition, OF Willie Calhoun, adjusts to MLB pitching. So far, he has only had 19 at bats this season but has shown promise with a .316 batting average and 2 home runs. 

Calhoun is not the only player on the Rangers that has potential to make an impact this season. 3B Adrian Beltre is coming off a 2017 season where he batted .312 with 17 homers and 71 RBIs and should continue to be a major offensive threat for the team. 

Another player to watch this year is pitcher Cole Hamels who had an 11–6 record with a 4.20 ERA last season. If Hamels can have another strong year, it will give the Rangers a good chance at making it to the playoffs. 

Overall, while there are some uncertainties surrounding the team this season, they have some strong players who could lead them to success. If everything falls into place, their odds of winning at 25/1 could prove to be a good investment.
