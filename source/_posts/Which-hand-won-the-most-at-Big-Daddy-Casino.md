#  Evaluate your poker hands to see if you could have won!

When playing poker, you should always be looking to make the best hand possible. This means evaluating all of your possible hands to see if you could have won. In some cases, it might be worth folding if you don't think you can win.

Here are five common poker hands and how to evaluate them:

One Pair

If you have one pair, then you should compare your pair to the other player's highest card. If your pair is higher, then you have a winning hand. If your pair is lower, then you should probably fold.

Two Pair

If you have two pairs, then you should compare the highest pairs first. The player with the highest pair wins. If there is a tie for the highest pair, then compare the second highest pairs to see who wins. If there is still a tie, then the players share the pot.

Three of a Kind

If you have three of a kind, then you should compare your three of a kind to the other player's highest card. If your three of a kind is higher, then you have a winning hand. If your three of a kind is lower, then you should probably fold.

Straight

If you have a straight, then you should compare your highest card to the other player's highest card. The player with the higher card wins. If there is a tie for the highest card, then compare the second-highest cards to see who wins. If there is still a tie, then the players share the pot.

  Flush 

If you have a flush, then you should compare your highest card to the other player's highest card. The player with the higher card wins. If there is a tie for the highest card, then compare the second-highest cards to see who wins."
