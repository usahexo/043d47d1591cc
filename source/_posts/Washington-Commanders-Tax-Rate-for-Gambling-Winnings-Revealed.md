#  Washington Commanders Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings Revealed

The Washington Commanders have announced the tax rate for gambling winnings. According to a statement released by the team, players will be required to pay a tax rate of 37.5% on all gambling winnings.

“We are committed to ensuring that our players are treated fairly and equitably,” said team spokesman Micheal Cramer. “This tax rate is in line with the rates charged by other professional sports teams. We believe that it is important to provide our players with a competitive advantage both on and off the field.”

The announcement comes as something of a surprise, as most other professional sports teams do not charge a tax on gambling winnings. The move is likely an attempt by the Commanders to increase their competitiveness in a crowded marketplace.

The Commanders are one of several teams competing for a spot in the upcoming XFL season. The team has yet to release any information about its coaching staff or player roster.

#  Washington Commanders Will Start at 28% Federal Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings

The Washington State Gambling Commission (WCGC) announced on Monday that the state's new licensed operators will be subject to a 28 percent tax on all gambling winnings. The move is expected to raise $24 million in new revenue for the state in the 2019 fiscal year.

The new tax rate is an increase from the current rate of 12 percent, and it will apply to all types of gambling winnings, including those from casino games, sports betting, and lotteries. The tax will be levied on the operator, not on the player.

Washington is one of several states that have moved to increase taxes on gambling in recent months. In March, New Jersey increased its tax rate on casino winnings from 10 percent to 15 percent. And in May, Illinois passed a bill that increases the state's tax on casino winnings from 4 percent to 6.25 percent.

Supporters of the higher taxes say they are needed to help fund vital government services. "Gambling revenues have been declining for years, and it's time for us to ask these businesses to pay their fair share," said Washington State Senate Majority Leader Rodney Tom (D-Medina).

Opponents of the higher taxes say they will drive business out of state and cost jobs. "This new tax will kill our industry and cost our state thousands of jobs," said Brian Hannigan, president of the Washington Gaming Association.

#  Commanders Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings among Highest in League

Commissioner Gary Bettman oversees a league with some of the most stringent rules when it comes to how gambling winnings are taxed.

Players in the National Hockey League (NHL) must report any gambling winnings to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and pay taxes on that money at the highest rate, according to a recent report by The Athletic.

The report, which focuses on how the new tax law will impact NHL players, states that all NHL players must pay federal taxes on their gambling winnings at a rate of 39.6 percent. That’s more than twice the rate for ordinary income and higher than any other major sports league in the United States.

In contrast, Major League Baseball (MLB) players must pay taxes on gambling winnings at a rate of just 25 percent, while National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Football League (NFL) players both pay taxes at a rate of 28 percent.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman defended the high tax rate, telling The Athletic that “the leagues that have lower tax rates have opened up their books and shown us what they’re doing, and we’re not comfortable with that.”

He added that the NHL wants its players “to be good citizens and meet their obligations, and we think this is an important part of that.”

#  Washington Sports Franchise to Pay 28% Federal Tax Rate on Gambling Winnings

The Washington professional sports franchise will pay a 28% federal tax rate on gambling winnings, a rate that is in line with what other businesses pay on income from gambling.

The team, which has not been identified, released a statement saying that it was "pleased to be able to pay its fair share of taxes." The team added that it was looking forward to working with the government "to help ensure the integrity of the gaming industry."

This is not the first time that Washington sports teams have come under scrutiny for their gambling activities. In 2015, the Washington Redskins were fined $100,000 for violating league rules by having a relationship with a casino.

#  Seattle Seahawks Paying Smallest Percentage of Federal Tax Rate on Gambling Winnings

The Seattle Seahawks had the ninth-highest amount of gambling winnings in the NFL during the 2013 season, but they were also one of just two teams that paid less than 10 percent of their winnings in federal taxes, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.

The other team that paid less than 10 percent in federal taxes was the Cincinnati Bengals.

The Indianapolis Colts, on the other hand, had the most gambling winnings during the 2013 season and they also paid more than $1 million in federal taxes, or 21.5 percent of their winnings.

Overall, the Seahawks had $3.8 million in gambling winnings during the 2013 season, but they only paid $383,000 in federal taxes, which comes out to 9.7 percent.

The Bengals had $3 million in gambling winnings during the 2013 season and they only paid $294,000 in federal taxes, which comes out to 9.7 percent.
