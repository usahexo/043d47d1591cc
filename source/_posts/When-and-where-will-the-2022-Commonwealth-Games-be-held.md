#  When and where will the 2022 Commonwealth Games be held?

The 2022 Commonwealth Games will be held in Birmingham, England from July 27 to August 7. The games were announced on November 9, 2017 at the NEC Birmingham. This is the first time that the games will be hosted in England since they were first held in 1930.

#  Which city will host the games?

The location of the Olympic Games is a hot topic in the news lately. The host city for the 2024 Olympic Games has not yet been decided, but there are several contenders. Paris, Los Angeles, and Budapest are all vying for the chance to host the prestigious event.

Paris is seen as the frontrunner for the bid. The city has a rich history with the Olympics, and last hosted the games in 1924. The French government has pledged to spend billions of euros on upgrading infrastructure in order to prepare for the games.

Los Angeles is also seen as a strong contender. The city has hosted the Olympics twice before, in 1932 and 1984. The LA bid committee has said that it will rely heavily on existing infrastructure to keep costs down.

Budapest is the underdog of the three cities. It submitted its bid only recently, and does not have as much experience hosting major events like Paris and Los Angeles do. However, Hungary is eager to bring back the games to Central Europe after they were held in London in 2012.

The final decision on who will host the 2024 Olympic Games will be made in September 2017 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

#  What sports will be competed in at the 2022 Commonwealth Games?

The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) released the sports which will be competed in at the 2022 Commonwealth Games on Monday, 4th March 2019. 

Athletics, Aquatics (Swimming and Diving), Badminton, Basketball, BMX Cycling, Boxing, Cycling, Gymnastics (Artistic and Rhythmic), Hockey, Lawn Bowls, Netball, Rugby Sevens, Shooting, Squash, Table Tennis and Triathlon will all feature on the programme in Birmingham. 

“With just under three years to go until Birmingham hosts the Commonwealth Games we are excited to confirm the sports which will be on the programme for what is set to be an amazing event” said CGF President Louise Martin. 

“We have a wonderful line-up of traditional and new sports which will excite athletes and fans alike. I am sure that everyone is looking forward to seeing world-class performances from some of the best athletes from around the Commonwealth as we come together in Birmingham in 2022.”

#  How many athletes are expected to participate in the 2022 Commonwealth Games?

The 2022 Commonwealth Games is expected to have 4,500 athletes participate from 71 countries.

#  What is the expected cost of hosting the games?

The expected cost of hosting the games is about $1.5 billion, according to a study conducted by Boston Consulting Group. The government will need to provide at least $1 billion for the games, and private companies will need to contribute the rest. The amount is larger than initially thought, but it’s still lower than the costs of previous Olympics.

Organizers hope that the games will give a boost to the economy, creating new jobs and generating money from tourism. However, many doubt that these benefits will be realized. Critics argue that Brazil is in the midst of an economic crisis and that the country cannot afford to host such an event.

Despite these concerns, Brazil is moving ahead with preparations for the games. The government has already started construction on several Olympic venues, including a new stadium in Rio de Janeiro. It’s unclear whether all these projects will be completed on time, but there’s no turning back now. The Olympics are coming to Brazil!
