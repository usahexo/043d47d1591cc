#  Red Devils Aim to Secure Minimum Bet Victory Over Baccarat Rivals

Manchester United will be looking to get a win under their belt when they take on Baccarat rivals Stoke City at Old Trafford this weekend.

Bethard Preview: Manchester United are big favourites for the win here, with odds of 1/4 on them securing all three points. The Potters, in contrast, are a long way out at 14/1, and it’s hard to see them getting anything from this game.

Stoke have been one of the poorest teams in the Premier League this season, and they come into this fixture on the back of a 5-1 hammering by Liverpool. Manchester United, by contrast, looked much improved against Tottenham last time out and will be confident of taking all three points.

One player who is likely to cause Stoke some problems is Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian striker has been in superb form recently, scoring 11 goals in his last 10 games for club and country. He will be eager to add to that tally against Stoke and help Manchester United secure an easy victory.

After a mixed start to their La Liga title defence, reigning champions Real Madrid announced they will be setting a minimum bet of €10 for their next game against Manchester United.

The move is seen as a way of boosting the morale of the team, who have seen their lead at the top of the table cut to just two points after seven games. club president Florentino Perez said in a statement: "We are all very confident in our ability to win this match and take another step towards defending our La Liga title. We believe in our players and we believe that this new measure will give them an extra boost heading into this crucial game."

United arrive in Madrid on the back of some good results themselves, including a 3-0 victory over Chelsea in their last game. However, they are still without key midfielder Paul Pogba, who is suspended for the match. Even so, manager Jose Mourinho is confident his team can get a result at the Bernabeu. "I know how difficult it is to play there, but I also know that our team is capable of anything," he said in a press conference on Tuesday. "We have to go out and give everything we have to get a result."

Both teams go into Wednesday's match with plenty still to play for, with Madrid looking to make up for their poor start to the season and United still chasing down Premier League leaders Manchester City.

#  Baccarat: Real Madrid CF Look to Secure Minimum Bet Victory

In their first leg of the semi-final tie against Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid CF secured a 1-1 draw at home. This gives Los Blancos the advantage as they travel to the Vicente Calderón Stadium on Wednesday night.

Both teams will be looking to secure a victory, but Real Madrid's minimum bet is a victory that would see them through to the final. Atlético will need to score at least two goals in order to take the game into extra time and then penalties.

If Atlético manage to score two goals, Real Madrid CF would need to score three in order to win the tie. Diego Simeone's side have been one of La Liga's strongest defensive teams this season, only conceding 27 goals in 38 games.

Real Madrid CF have scored more goals than any other team in La Liga (93) and will be confident that they can find a way past Atlético's defence. Gareth Bale is expected to start for Los Blancos and he will be looking to make an impact in the game.

Bale has scored seven goals in his last six appearances for Real Madrid CF and he will be determined to help his team reach the final of the Champions League. Cristiano Ronaldo has also been in excellent form recently, scoring 43 goals in all competitions this season.

Atlético Madrid will also be confident of getting a result, but they will need to be careful not to concede an away goal which would make their task even harder. Antoine Griezmann has been one of their key players this season and he will be looking to score his first goal against Real Madrid CF.
