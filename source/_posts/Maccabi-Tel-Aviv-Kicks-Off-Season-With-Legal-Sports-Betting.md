#  Maccabi Tel Aviv Kicks Off Season With Legal Sports Betting

The 2019-2020 season of the Israeli Premier League kicked off last week, with Maccabi Tel Aviv taking on Bnei Yehuda. The match was a high-scoring affair, with Maccabi winning 5-2.

This season sees the return of legal sports betting in Israel. Betting on sports has been illegal in the country since 1998, but that changed in July, when the Knesset passed a law legalizing it.

There is now a wide range of sports that people in Israel can bet on, including soccer, basketball, baseball, and American football. There are also a number of online platforms that offer sports betting in the country, including SportPesa and 888Sport.

Legalizing sports betting has been seen as a way to help boost the Israeli economy. According to estimates from the Finance Ministry, legalizing sports betting could bring in as much as 2 billion shekels (approximately $520 million) in annual tax revenue.

Some opponents of the law have raised concerns about gambling addiction and its potential negative effects on society. However, others argue that legalizing sports betting will help regulate an industry that has long been operating illegally.

Regardless of these concerns, it seems that legalized sports betting is here to stay in Israel. And for fans of soccer and other sports, thatâ€™s good news indeed!
