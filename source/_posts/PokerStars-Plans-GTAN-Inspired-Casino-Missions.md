#  PokerStars Plans GTAN Inspired Casino Missions

PokerStars is partnering with Dutch game developer Gambitious Digital Entertainment to create a series of casino-set missions for its PokerStars Casino app inspired by the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) video game franchise. The first mission, "The Robbery", is expected to be released in early 2019.

"The Robbery" will see players take on the role of a poker player who has been tasked with robbing a casino. The mission will require players to make strategic decisions throughout the robbery, including how to handle the security guards and police officers who are trying to thwart the heist.

In addition to "The Robbery", PokerStars plans to release several other casino-inspired missions in 2019, including "The Heist" and "The Showdown". All of the missions will be available for free download on PokerStars Casino.

"We're always looking for new and innovative ways to enhance the user experience on our site," said Severin Rasset, Director of Poker Innovation and Operations at PokerStars. "Gambitious has created some truly unique missions that will bring an exciting new dimension to our casino product."

"Gambitious is proud to partner with PokerStars on this project," said Christina van Dijk, CEO of Gambitious Digital Entertainment. "The team at Gambitious has years of experience developing video games and we're excited to bring our creative expertise to help develop these new casino missions."

#  How To Host Casino Missions In GTAN

Hosting casino missions in GTAN can be a fun and profitable experience for all players. In order to host casino missions, you must own or have access to a casino property. The casino property can be found in the yellow highlighted area on the map below. Once you have the property, enter the interior and click on the “mission board” to start hosting casino missions.

There are three different types of casino missions: blackjack, roulette, and slot machines. For each type of mission, there are three different levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. The harder the level, the greater the rewards.

In order to start a blackjack mission, you must first select your table. There are three different tables to choose from: standard, VIP, and high roller. The higher the table, the greater the rewards. Once you’ve selected your table, you must then select your bet amount. The bet amount can be anywhere from $1 to $100000. Once you’ve selected your bet amount, you can then start the mission by clicking on “play”.

In order to start a roulette mission, you must first select your wheel type: single or double zero. The single zero wheel has a lower house edge than the double zero wheel. Once you’ve selected your wheel type, you must then set your bet amount. The bet amount can be anywhere from $1 to $100000. Once you’ve set your bet amount, you can then start the mission by clicking on “play”.

In order to start a slot machine mission, you must first select your bet amount. The bet amount can be anywhere from $1 to $20000. Once you’ve set your bet amount, you can then start the mission by clicking on “play”.
