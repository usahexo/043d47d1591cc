#  When Was Bingo First Invented in New Zealand? 

The first game of bingo is said to have been invented in 1530 by a Catholic priest in Italy. However, it’s unclear if this is true or not. It’s also hard to say when bingo was first played in New Zealand specifically. There are some records that suggest it was being played by the early 1900s, but there’s no concrete evidence to back this up. 

What we do know for certain is that bingo became extremely popular in New Zealand during the 1950s and 1960s. This was largely thanks to the arrival of television, which meant that more people had access to the game. In fact, by the late 1960s there were around 100 bingo clubs throughout the country! 

Today, bingo remains a popular pastime in New Zealand. In fact, there are now more than 200 clubs throughout the country, and thousands of people play every week. So if you’re looking for a fun and exciting way to spend an evening, why not give bingo a try?

#  How Old Is the New Zealand Bingo Scene? 

The history of bingo in New Zealand is a little blurry, with reports that it was brought over by British immigrants in the early 20th century. However, there is little evidence to support this claim.

Since then, bingo has grown in popularity and can now be found at clubs and casinos around the country. While the basic rules of the game have remained unchanged, the bingo scene has evolved over time, with new variations and games being introduced. For example, in recent years there has been a rise in popularity of electronic bingo, which is played on a computer screen rather than a traditional bingo card.

How old is the New Zealand bingo scene? It’s difficult to say for sure, but it’s probably been around for several decades. Today, there are dozens of clubs and casinos that offer bingo games, and thousands of people enjoy playing it every week.
