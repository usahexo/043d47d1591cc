#  What is the origin of the JoyCasino brand name?

The JoyCasino brand was started in 1994, when the first online casino was created. At that time, there were only a handful of online casinos, so it was a pretty innovative and new concept. The brand nameJoyCasino is actually derived from two words - "joy" and "casino". The founders of the company wanted to create a brand that would evoke feelings of happiness and excitement, and they felt that the word "casino" would perfectly embody those feelings.

Initially, JoyCasino was only available in Russian, but it has since expanded to include other languages as well. The company has also added other gambling products to its repertoire, such as sports betting and poker. In recent years, JoyCasino has become one of the most popular online casinos in Europe, thanks to its high-quality games and exciting promotions.
