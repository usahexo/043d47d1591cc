Firstly, the minimum bet is $0.10 and the maximum bet is $100. Secondly, you must place your bet before the cards are dealt. Thirdly, the game only uses a deck of 52 cards. Lastly, Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.</p>
<p>The object of the game is score as many points as possible by counting the points of the cards in your hand. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins. If there is a tie, then the player with the highest value card in their hand wins. If there is still a tie after that, then the pot is split evenly between the tied players.</p>
<p>Below are some example hands and how they would be scored:</p>
<p>Example 1: You are dealt (5,7,8,9). Your points would be 5+7+8+9&#x3D;29.</p>
<p>Example 2: You are dealt (4,4,J,Q). Your points would be 4+4+10+10&#x3D;28.</p>
<p>Example 3: You are dealt (3,2,A). Your points would be 3+2+1&#x3D;6.</p>
<p>As you can see from these examples, it is important to try and get as many high-point cards as possible to maximize your score.</p>

With just a $1 bet, you could win up to $10,000. So how much money can you win playing this game?</p>
<p>To figure out the answer, we need to take a look at the payouts for the different prize levels. In the Magic 10 game, you can win prizes of $1, $5, $10, $25, $100, $500, or $10,000. The payout for each of these prizes is shown in the table below.</p>
<p>Prize Payout $1 75% $5 60% $10 40% $25 30% $100 20% $500 10% $10,000 5%</p>
<p>So if you bet $1 and hit the winning combination for a prize of $1, you would win 75 cents (75% of your bet). If you hit the winning combination for a prize of $10,000, you would win 5 cents (5% of your bet).</p>

<h1 id="Can-You-Beat-San-Manuel-Casino’s-Magic-10-Game"><a href="#Can-You-Beat-San-Manuel-Casino’s-Magic-10-Game" class="headerlink" title="Can You Beat San Manuel Casino’s Magic 10 Game?"></a>Can You Beat San Manuel Casino’s Magic 10 Game?</h1><p>Can you beat San Manuel Casino’s Magic 10 game?</p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p>The key is to first understand how the game works.</p>
<p>The Magic 10 game is a slots game that offers players the chance to win a progressive jackpot. The game is played on a 5x3 grid and has ten fixed paylines. Players can bet up to 10 coins on each line, for a total bet of 100 coins per spin.</p>
<p>To win the progressive jackpot, players must hit the magic Jackpot symbol on the central payline. Other symbols in the game include bells, bars, cherries and 7s.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to play the game, let’s look at some tips for winning it.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when playing the Magic 10 game is to always bet the maximum number of coins possible. This will increase your chances of hitting the Jackpot symbol and winning the progressive jackpot.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the Jackpot symbol appears more often when you bet more coins. So make sure you are betting max every time you play!</p>
<p>In addition, be sure to keep an eye on the other symbols in the game as well. The bell, bar and cherry symbols all offer payouts when they appear three or four times on an enabled payline. And while they don’t offer as big of a payout as the Jackpot symbol, they can still help contribute to your overall winnings.</p>
